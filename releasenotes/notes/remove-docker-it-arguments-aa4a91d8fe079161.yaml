deprecations:
  - |
    Running INTERACTIVE mode (docker exec -it) on docker-wrapper-scripts is no longer possible.
fixes:
  - |
    Adding command line option "-t" on docker exec results into adding \r\n newlines on output, making shell parsing more difficult.
    The default options "-it" are not necessary on wrapper-scripts and have been removed therefore.
